<body><h1>X12 - Modern, Fully Compatible X11 Replacement</h1>
  <h2>Evolve, Don't Abandon</h2>
  <p><b><u>Both this document and project are in a very early stage, willing to change at any time without prior notice</b></u></p>
  <p>X12 is not a break from X11, it is a refinement. A continuation, not a rebellion. While Wayland seeks to erase the past, X12 builds upon it. It honors the original X11 architecture, composability, network transparency, and decoupled layers, while confronting the weight of legacy with surgical precision. This is not a rewrite for its own sake. This is what XFree86 might have become had it chosen evolution over rupture.</p>
  <p><strong>X12 stands for a cleaned-up, security-aware, modular continuation of X11, while also offering minimal legacy baggage, and modern extensions.</strong></p>
  <p>We begin with continuity as our guiding principle. X12 revives the conceptual strength of X11, modular compositing, clean separation of input/output, remote display, while discarding the sediment of outdated extensions, tangled authentication, and fragile configuration models. It retains compatibility without compromise, but introduces a saner, secure, and more modern protocol core under the surface.</p>

  <h2>A Modern Successor That Doesn't Burn Bridges</h2>
  <p>At its heart, X12 is a modern fork: a protocol, a server, and a philosophy. It keeps what works, rips out what doesn't, and rewrites the wire format to something safe, typed, and introspectable. The new protocol core is schema-based, versioned, and asynchronous. But critically, X12 still runs unmodified GTK, Qt, SDL, and Motif applications. If it can't run <code>xeyes</code>, it doesn't qualify. Compatibility isn't a feature, it's the foundation.</p>
  <p>The architecture separates concerns with surgical clarity. Input policy, window management, and rendering are composable and swappable. The server core, reimplemented in memory-safe languages like Rust, isolates legacy code behind sandboxed modules. IPC is no longer an afterthought, Cap'n Proto replaces DBus-style bloat with a schema-driven, low-latency backbone. Even the network stack gets reimagined with tunneled, multiplexed, compressed streams that outperform both X11-over-SSH and Wayland's fragmented ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>Fixing What X11 Got Wrong, Without Losing What It Got Right</h2>
  <p>X11's flaws are well known: ancient font handling, chaotic input codepaths, patchwork authentication, and a baroque protocol. X12 addresses these head-on. Authentication becomes per-client, namespaced, and policy-governed. Input is abstracted from device handling, letting compositors and WMs manage policy cleanly. The render pipeline is cleaned up: DRM/KMS and Vulkan support are built-in, with optional software fallback for headless testing. Remote display becomes a first-class citizen again, authenticated, compressed, latency-compensated, and robust.</p>
  <p>Tooling is modern from day one. New utilities like <code>x12ctl</code>, <code>x12spy</code>, and <code>x12stat</code> offer real introspection and debugging, something X11 developers have gone decades without. A framebuffer prototype lays the groundwork: a testable, headless server that speaks the X12 protocol and renders minimal surfaces. Once stable, the plan is to integrate Vulkan, OpenGL, and DRM renderers. Then come compatibility modules for Xlib and XCB, and a path to cleanly isolate Xorg's spaghetti into a legacy core.</p>

  <h2>Not Just a Fork, A Clean Break with the Right Parts Preserved</h2>
  <p>X12 is MIT-licensed. It's free to fork, extend, commercialize, frictionless by design. Think busybox for display servers. Minimal builds for embedded use. Full-stack compositing for desktops. Optionality baked in at every level.</p>
  <p>But it's not just about modularity. It's about honoring what X11 got right. Wayland's minimalism is seductive, but it's also limiting. It forces WMs to reinvent the wheel. It ignores remote display. It places strictures on debugging, composability, and even things like multi-device input and clipboard access. By contrast, X12 preserves the UNIX philosophy: small parts, clean interfaces, and composability.</p>

  <h2>Why Not Wayland? Because Rewriting Is Not Improving</h2>
  <p>Wayland solved real problems, but at the cost of breaking everything. It threw out compatibility, introspection, and the network model that made X11 adaptable. And then it left compositors and toolkit developers to pick up the pieces. The result: fragmentation, duplicated effort, and an ecosystem where developers are stuck debugging black-box protocols.</p>
  <p>X12 refuses that route. Instead, it keeps the strengths, the flexibility, the remote capabilities, the decoupled architecture, and modernizes everything else. This isn't about sentimentality. It's about robustness. It's about building something that works today and can evolve tomorrow.</p>

  <h2>More Than Just Ideals</h2>
  <p>To make X12 real, we're not starting from abstractions. We're building concrete prototypes. A framebuffer server that handles window creation, movement, and destruction. A lightweight C API (<code>libX12</code>) that abstracts session setup, message handling, and input delivery. Then we layer in the heavy parts, DRM, Vulkan, legacy compatibility, all wrapped in clean, replaceable modules.</p>
  <p>Legacy extensions like core fonts, SHM, or XDMCP are retained but routed through safer abstractions. We'll use legacy code where needed but keep it sandboxed. For new development, Cap'n Proto becomes the default IPC, efficient, typed, introspectable. We'll use version negotiation to avoid the version hell that X11 fell into. Even Xlib and XCB support will come from a legacy compatibility core, carved out from Xorg, isolated, then modularized.</p>

  <h2>Security from Day One</h2>
  <p>X12 is designed for multi-user, secure environments. Each client gets its own namespace. Screen capture and input grabbing require explicit, enforceable policy grants. Clipboard access is mediated. No more magical trust assumptions. The X11 network model, brilliant but naive, is replaced with encrypted, authenticated tunnels. Like SSH, but better. Optional latency compensation and per-pixel delta streaming bring remote usability into the modern age.</p>

  <h2>A Clear Path Forward</h2>
  <p>The roadmap is aggressive, but grounded. We start with a working prototype, not a whitepaper. Build a software-only compositor. Integrate libinput and evdev. Add surface drawing. From there, Vulkan and DRM backends follow. Only once the core is stable do we bring in legacy compatibility. Each step is testable. Each component modular. Each assumption examined and made explicit.</p>
  <p>The final goal is simple: X12 must be a drop-in replacement for X11, while offering a superior path forward. That means GTK, Qt, SDL, and even old-school Xt apps must run without patches. It means existing tools like <code>xauth</code>, <code>xdm</code>, and <code>xrandr</code> must continue to function, even if behind the scenes, they interact with modernized abstractions.</p>

  <h2>A Modular Future, Without Compromise</h2>
  <p>The display stack doesn't need to be monolithic. With X12, each piece, compositor, renderer, input policy engine, can be replaced, upgraded, or stripped down. Want a pure framebuffer server with no acceleration? Possible. Need Vulkan-backed rendering with HDR support? Pluggable. Want to isolate input devices for sandboxing? Trivial. X12 provides a skeleton and lets implementers flesh it out.</p>
  <p>We're also ditching assumptions. No more hardcoded 65536x65536 coordinate systems. No more fixed input devices. No monolithic event loops. Even the message passing is schema-versioned, so components can evolve independently.</p>

  <h2>X12 Is the Future Path X11 Never Took</h2>
  <p>Preserving the ecosystem is not nostalgia. It's strategy. Thousands of applications depend on X11. Dozens of libraries wrap it. Toolkits, window managers, games, CAD tools, IDEs, they all rely on a stable, flexible, introspectable display stack. X12 is the only serious attempt to modernize X11 without killing its legacy.</p>
  <p>It is just not symbolic. Is about what matters. Until we ship introspection tools that make <code>x11perf</code> look like a relic. Until our remote display protocol outperforms both VNC and Wayland.</p>

  <h2>Join Us</h2>
  <p>If you believe that compatibility is power, that composability is not negotiable, and that evolution beats revolution, then X12 is where you belong. We're not here to start over. We're here to finish what X11 began.</p>
  <p>Let's prove the UNIX philosophy still matters. Let's build the display stack X11 was always meant to become.</p>
